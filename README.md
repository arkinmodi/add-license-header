## Managed vs Un-Managed

In managed mode (the default), the license header will contain
`LICENSE HEADER MANAGED BY add-license-header` in first line of the comment
block. This enabled the tool to be able to accurately find the license header
and allows you to place the license header anywhere in the file.

In unmanaged mode, enabled with the `--unmanaged` flag, the top-most comment
block will be assumed to be the license header.
